# Data-Mining Final Project (Using R)

In this report, I was tasked with finding the best variables to measure ones ability to pay off or not pay off their loans. I used three machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and KNN Nearest Neighbors. Since I was given a larger dataset, I concluded that the Logistic Regression was the best algorithm to use in finding the best predictors. I am thankful to have finished well in this class as I earned an A+. I hope you enjoy viewing my report.


## Boxplot

This boxplot shows the frequency of delinquency on each type of debt organized by customers who have fully paid off their debt or have not fully paid off their debt.

## ROC Curve

This chart shows the ROC curve of a quadratic discriminant analysis algorithm, the higher sloped curve, the more efficient model

## Vip Graph

This chart shows the most effective variables to use when trying to predict if someone is going to be able to pay off their loans versus those who will not be able to pay off their loans
